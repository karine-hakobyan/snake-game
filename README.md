Playing:
In order to start playing this game on local PC, the following steps should be performed
1. git clone https://github.com/karine-hakobyan/snake-game.git
2. cd snake-game
3. npm install
4. npm start

TODO:
1. Implement responsive view
2. Enhancements in the code

Bugs:
1. Possible to do 180 degree turn when the snake is fully in horizontal/vertical position
   (Expected result: should not react on 180 degree turn key press)
2. Possible to click 'Start game' button during the game.
    (Expected result: 'Start game' button should be disabled during the game)
